About Me

I’m a Honours Business Degree student at Seneca Polytechnic with hands-on experience in financial operations and analysis. I’m especially interested in commercial banking and financial analyst roles where strong analysis and clear thinking matter.

Financial Analysis Portfolio

This repository brings together three financial analysis projects I built independently to show how I approach credit decisions, investment analysis, and financial forecasting. Each project is structured the way I’ve seen real teams work: clear assumptions, clean models, and conclusions that actually mean something for decision-makers.

Quick Look (If You’re Skimming)

Commercial credit analysis for a $2.5M loan using a Big-5-style framework
Risk-return analysis of a $228K equity portfolio
Revenue forecasting model using 12 quarters of Canadian Tire data with 91.8% accuracy
Tools used: Advanced Excel, Python, Power BI, SQL
If something catches your eye, the details are right below and inside each model.

What I’m Good At

Finance & Banking: Credit analysis, financial modeling, forecasting, ratio analysis, covenant monitoring
Quantitative: Regression, time series, volatility, Sharpe ratio, CAGR
Tools: Excel (advanced), Python, Power BI, SQL, Tableau

Project 1: Commercial Credit Analysis (TD-Style)

File: TD_Commercial_Credit_Analysis_FINAL.xlsx
This project walks through how I would evaluate a $2.5M term loan for a mid-market manufacturing company. The goal wasn’t just to calculate ratios, but to decide whether the loan should be approved and how the risk should be managed.

What I Looked At
Liquidity, leverage, profitability, and cash-flow coverage
How the borrower compares to Ontario manufacturing benchmarks
Where the real risks are, not just what the numbers say

Key Results
DSCR: 2.42x
Current Ratio: 2.85x
Debt-to-Equity: 0.67x
Net Margin: 5.1%

Credit Decision
I recommended approval with a moderate risk rating, supported by a covenant package and a quarterly monitoring dashboard. The model includes early-warning indicators so issues can be flagged before they become problems.

This file is fully built out with assumptions, formulas, and a structure similar to what you’d see in a commercial credit package.

Project 2: Investment Portfolio Performance Analysis

File: Portfolio_Analysis_Complete.xlsx

Here I analyzed a $228K equity portfolio made up of 10 large-cap stocks across 7 sectors. The focus was on understanding both return and risk, not just which stocks performed best.

What I Did
Calculated position-level and portfolio-weighted returns
Measured volatility using monthly returns and annualized it
Evaluated risk-adjusted performance using the Sharpe ratio

Key Results
Total Return: 16.44%
Annualized Volatility: 5.59%
Sharpe Ratio: 2.14
Portfolio Beta: 0.73

The takeaway: the portfolio delivered strong returns while staying relatively defensive, which is exactly what I was trying to test with the diversification strategy.

All calculations tie back to a raw data sheet, so it’s easy to follow how each number was built.

Project 3: Canadian Tire Revenue Forecasting
File: Canadian_Tire_Revenue_Forecast_DETAILED.xlsx
This model is built like something you’d see in an FP&A or finance team. I used 12 quarters of Canadian Tire revenue data to understand trends, seasonality, and what future performance might look like.

How I Approached It

Reviewed historical growth and calculated a 3.2% CAGR
Identified clear seasonality, with Q4 peaking at 113.6%
Built and compared three forecasting methods:
Linear regression
Moving average
Seasonal decomposition

Validation & Results
I tested the forecasts using MAPE and RMSE, which gave an overall accuracy of 91.8%. Based on the model, I projected 2025 revenue of $15.8B CAD.
More importantly, the model explains why the numbers move the way they do, not just what the output is.


A Quick Note on Data

These projects were created independently for learning and portfolio purposes. The credit and portfolio data is hypothetical, while the Canadian Tire model uses publicly available financial disclosures.
